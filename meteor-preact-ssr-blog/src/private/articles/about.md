My name is Chris Visser. Sometimes nicknamed Cloudspider. 
I'm a creative problem solver and software developer with focus on the web and cloud - 
Intrinsically driven with an infinite amount of curiosity and will to learn. 

My curiosity and motivation to learn often translates to a high level of creativity and out of the box ideas, 
but also result sometimes in some very bad word-jokes. For me it’s just a matter of combining the stuff that I 
love and this makes me literally a ‘spider in a web’ of ideas.

## I shine in 

- Web development
- Creative thinking
- Asking the right questions
- Consultancy & Presentations
- Trend watching & trend predictions

## My personality

I know my strengths, but also my weaknesses. Therefore I know when to say "This is not my area", 
"advice me", "help me" or "lets do it together". I absolutely believe that these ingredients make me 
a powerful asset to any team. Knowing your own role makes you so much more valuable with your own expertise!

## How I operate
Present me with a problem or a hunch and I will start asking questions 'before' we dive in. 
Asking my way of getting knowledge about what you and your (potential?) customers 'really' want. 
*Why do you want it? Why do your customers want it? 
Why does it help you? Why is this the right idea? Who is it for?*

I want to understand your motivations to extract what makes your hunch valuable for you 
and the world around us. Now that the understanding is there, it makes me motivated too! Your goal 
becomes my goal and with my expertise we can make this potentially awesome thing happen!
